## Welcome to my Corner of GitHub
My name's Simon and I'm an embedded software developer by profession.
I develop software for telematics units for off-highway machinery and have the occasional side-project which I do in my free time.

I also have an [Internet presence](https://www.simonc.eu) where I will occasionally write a little blog post, tutorial or something similar and then delete it because I didn't like it after a few weeks!.

If you're here, you've probably stumbled on one of my open-source projects and might be looking for documentation.
Not to worry, I have [a link for that, too](https://documentation.simonc.eu)!
It's not the prettiest portion of my website, but I'll get to that eventually. At least it's permanent darkmode.

## My Tech Stack

### Technology I use
I'm a firm believer of "use whatever suits you and what you like", as such the list of tech I use (on a daily basis) is quite varied.

#### My Main Machines
My main machines which I use for everyday tasks, like gaming, developing and just general gits and shiggles are in no particular order:

 - M1 Pro MacBook Pro (16")
 - Custom-Built Gaming PC running Windows (+ WSL) / Linux
 - \<Enter top-of-the-line Android smartphone model here>

#### My Favourite Languages
I develop software for a living and as a hobby, and have done so for over a decade now.
In the meantime I've come to love and hate some programming languagues.

Here's a list of my favourites (in no particular order)!

 - C++
 - C#
 - Lua
 - Bash
 - Swift

#### Languages I won't touch with a 50ft pole if I don't have to
As with all things in life, some languages just don't fit a given person's personality.
Be it you've shot yourself in the foot, or the "core features"/"selling points" of the language are simply infuriating to you.

For me, those are:

 - Python
 - Visual Basic
 - JavaScript (ECMAscript, whatever)
 - Perl

#### Languages I'm aquainted with
You have friends, you have enemies and then you have those in life, whom you don't really know, but are curious to know more about.
For me, these languages are in that weird area of my brain where they make me think about them, and try to find reasons to love or hate.

 - Rust
 - Objective C

## My Projects
My projects range from public to private, to weird semi-complete WIPs.
A lot of these I've started but due to circumstances in my life, couldn't complete, or found the current state usable enough to just keep them as-is.

A lot of recent projects have come into life because of my private IT stuff, but also because of passion projects at work, where I've created better versions for my personal use.

Just scroll through my repositories and see if you like anything.
